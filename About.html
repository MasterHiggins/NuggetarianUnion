    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">About</h1>
    <p>
        The Nuggetarian Union is related to a vast and expansive history of former empires founded by the first president, Christopher Higgins.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first nation, the Nuggetarian Empire, was founded in 2021. It had a relatively small population and led by one emperor. It was vast and 
        set the precedent of the Nuggetarian Design, a style of architecture that government building still try to follow today.
    </p>
    <p>
        The real start was the second one, which was also referred to as the Nuggetarian Empire. It was founded in 2022, first named <u>The Village</u>,
        by Tyler Higgins. The first election was held the same day it was founded, with Tyler and Christopher both running against each other, but Tyler
        won in a landslide. After that, there was slow progress up until the second election. After Tyler resigned, Christopher ran uncontested and became
        the first titled Emperor, though Tyler was the first ruler. Chris brought a mail system, tax reform, and currency goals, as well as games. He served
        two non-consecutive terms, with the first one having him lose to Sayer Chippett, a former minister in Chris' government. Emperor Sayer mostly continued
        the policies Chris was working towards, and resigned after serving the full term. Chris won again uncontested, and brought the empire through a war.
        In the last election of the empire, Chris, Sayer, and even Tyler all ran for another chance. Despite harsh campaigning from Chris and Tyler, and a soft
        campaign from Sayer, Sayer won in a close vote. The empire was soon dissolved, and what remained of it became a business for the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Ultimate Nuggetarian Empire was founded later, in the Summer of 2023. Founded this time by Chris, it was made instead into a Monarchy, with Chris
        being it's only leader. This was a prosperous empire, with more notable achievements being the territory it controlled. Currently, it is the second largest
        empire to date, with the largest being the one after it. Chris waged wars against threats to the nation, including another empire, Sterzonia. Sterzonia, while
        small, was hostile at times with an individual, Fisher. This led to a near catastrophic war between Sterzonia and the Nuggetarians, but ultimately it never
        got to that. Instead, they had for friendly competitions, such as the Potato war, which lasted for the second half of the world's lifespan.
    </p>
    <p>
        The United Nuggetarian Empire was different, taking place on a replica of Earth. This was also a Monarchy, and under Chris, it flourished. It was the 
        largest empire in history, most territory, most reserves, biggest military, etc. By the end of it, they just didn't have a small portion of Russia. Even
        Antarctica was controlled by the Nuggetarians. Three empires fell within the lifespan of the United Nuggetarian Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, Chris vowed not to get politically involved. Instead, he started a lucrative business in the next world in the Summer of 2023. Two empires formed,
        the Spawn Empire and the Elden Empire, but both wanted Chris to have some role in the government. After it was discovered that Chris was a compromised asset for both
        parties, he used his business land to form a new empire, going back to the old roots with the name Nuggetarian Empire. This empire got along well with the others,
        and soon after, Chris bought Spawn Empire, and extablished a union for fast travel between the Elden Empire and the Nuggetarian Empire. It is, to date, the smallest
        empire, but it has the most impressive infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that is the history up until now. Back to a democracy, Chris will serve as the first president.
    </p>

    <b>Current History - Chris Presidency</b>

    <p>
        Chris began the nation by singing independance on March 22nd, 2025. There was no election, and the next term after 2 weeks also had no real 
        election as Chris ran unopposed. At the start of his second term, he signed amendments to committee powers, and called an early election. 
        Hoping for a strong mandate as vice President, he lost the bid to Fisher, who recieved 67 committee votes against Chris' 33. After a scandal the
        next day, Chris ousted him from the committee and replaced him with Elissa. The next Sunday, a committee election was held where Elissa was 
        the only one running to be Vice President. That Tuesday, Chris announced his intent to resign from the presidency in a week, and Elissa would be 
        sworn in as the next President two days before the scheduled election.
