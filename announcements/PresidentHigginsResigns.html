    <p>
        Back in March I first assumed the office to be the first President of the Nuggetarian Union, and I worked to build the nation into the absolute 
        powerhouse it is now. Every citizen has armour and security with finances aplenty, and foreign populations have benfitted tremendously from my 
        tenure as the President of the Nuggetarian Union.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe that I have now set up the nation to choose a successor without me, and I am ready for that. It has been a priviledge to serve, and I 
        am grateful to have continued the long streak of my leadership between empires, but it is time for it to come to an end. I intend to resign from 
        the position of Nuggetarian Union President by the end of the week. On Wednesday, I will be signing my last order, which will solidify my resignation, 
        as well as dissolve this session of the Presidential Committee and government. I will serve the next term to ensure a smooth transition, and then 
        I will retire from public service.
    </p>

    <p>
        This might not have been the biggest surprise. I wasn't secretive about there being an early end to the term, my recent tenure has seen less and 
        less legislation get signed, and even this budget was smaller than usual, only tapping into the reserves by about 30%. In reality,  have been 
        preparing my political allies for this move.
    </p>

    <p>
        When my resignation comes into effect on Wednesday, I will be appointing Fisher, a committee officer, as the acting president until the election 
        this Thursday.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have served the Nuggetarian Empires as the consecutive leader since 2022. I always knew that I would merely establish the empire and global relations 
        this time before taking a back seat.
