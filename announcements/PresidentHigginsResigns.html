        <div>President Christopher Higgins</div>

    <p>
        Back in March, I founded the Nuggetarian Union and continued my consecutive rule as president, a lineage that I have held for now 6 consecutive 
        empires. Currently, I am serving the third term of my presidency, after being extablished as the first president by default, and running unopposed
        the second time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had a few goals. Moderation, which has been achieved, progression, which has been achieved, basic rights, which has been achieved, and so 
        much more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of you might have already seen this coming. Last term, I dismissed the government after establishing the office of the Vice President, and 
        now, it is time to set the precedent. I have now set up the empire to be left in good hands to a potential successor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Last night, I informed the members of my Committee, Vice President and Officer Fisher, and Officer Mackenzie, the same thing that I decided I would 
        do last term, and the same thing I am announcing today.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I intend to resign as the president of the Nuggetarian Union next Tuesday.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you count all my empires, I've been serving consecutively since the Ultimate Nuggetarian Empire over 3 years ago. It's now time for a pause, 
        at least, from such a high title.
    </p>

    <p>
        With my resignation, I have asked Vice President/Committee Officer Fisher to become the next President. He has agreed, and I have already drafted 
        the piece of legislation required to sign for both my resignation and his ascension to the presidency.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will still continue to serve in the government, and I have offered my effort to Fisher to serve on his committee to continue my duty as 
        the officer of Finance.
    </p>

    <p>
        It has been a privilege to serve as the president of the Nuggetarian Union, which, by large, affected the entire world.
    </p>
