    <p>
        I am delighted to say that the Nuggetarian Union now has a website for citizens to freely use.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website will be a hub for all information regarding the Union, including laws, announcements, and general information, such as what
        tax rates currently are or if there is an early election, where to vote, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        This announcement section will be used commonly through my administration for fast information whenever needed, such as threat or issues.
    </p>
