        <b>It's time to begin thinking about the empire.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yesterday, the Nuggetarian Union reached 50% of the global population. Today, I am making efforts to increase that.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have signed a new executive order that will provide a number of bonuses within the next two weeks, meaning that two weeks from now is
        the last possible opportunity to join with these bonuses.
    </p>

    <p>
        People who join the empire within the next two weeks will have no sales tax, and a tax rate of 2%. Normally, it would be 7%. They will also
        have a 50 Iron credit rather than the 25 Standard Iron credit policy. Business Tax will also be temporarily dropped to 5%
    </p>

    <p>
        As well, newcomers will recieve 128 Iron upon their next Tax collection, which is always election day. While this is subject to being taxed, the 
        average individual will actually get 45 iron back in taxes with the above 50 Iron credit, meaning that you will also get 45 extra Iron from this
        deal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, the government will provide 2 sets of Iron Armour (Boots, Leggings, Chestplate, Helmet), and two tool sets (Sword, Pickaxe). This is a
        58 Iron Value on top of all the other bonuses. You will also receive 32 bread and 32 torches.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are further than 600 meters from the province of Nuggetaria, then you may be subject to slighltly higher rates in the future due to maintenance
        costs, but I currently do not intend to change that. Under my administration, everyone will pay the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this entices you to join the Nuggetarian Union, please contact the government during this temporary offer period. You will not be able to declare 
        Soft Reset or any other method to leave the empire until April 24th, 2025, however you may stay as long as you would like after that date.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help with taxes in two weeks, please use the new taxation tool launched today.
