    <p>
        Today, the Nuggetarian Union shifted leadership from the President to the committee. As such, the committee has made several changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Effective in Term 6, citizens will have to pay the default Tax rates set by the next budget. Government workers will have to pay double 
        rates. UBI will be set to 96 Iron. If the reserves go back up to 12,000 Iron, then this will all be reverted.
    </p>

    <p>
        The foreign mining tax is now permanently set to 80%. If a nonresident wants to avoid the tax, they can purchase a lifetime mining pass.
        Unlike other tax changes, this will not automatically revert.
    </p>

    <p>
        Acts 7-2, 7-10, 7-18, and 7-22 have been temporarily suspended, except for 7-2. The UBI Act (7-2) will be modified to allow for the changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        There has been a revised deficit contract with a different corporation for if the reserves deplete to 0 Iron left.
    </p>
