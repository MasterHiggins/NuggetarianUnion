    <p>
        Citizens of the world,
    </p>

    <p>
        As one of the largest government super powers, it is understandable that decisions taken by the government of the Nuggetarian Union can often 
        lead to global consequence. Just yesterday, there were threats to go after potentially several parties after unintentionally harmful threats.
        Despite being an individual nation, the world does heed to our decisions at times.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, the two amendments affecting the committee has passed. This means that the committee will now get 100 votes divided among the members 
        proportionally. It gives them more power to strike down laws, file motions, propose laws to the president, and begin a process of impeachment,
        which serves for the Union as a sort of motion of no confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of these monumental changes on top of the Foreign Rights Act, I have made the decision to call the next election early, for this Thursday,
        April 10th, 2025. I am hoping for a string committee and mandate as we complete construction efforts, expand influence, and near a Iron total of 
        7,000.
    </p>

        <b>
            How this will affect payroll, UBI, and taxes
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Because payroll is percentage based, it will be going out this week, same as UBI. Officer Mackenzie has collected her pay early, so she will 
        get the difference taken from that, which we are legally required to disclose. Tax collection has already been calculated, and will go ahead
        on Wednesday. Please use our <a href = "../TaxTool.html">Tax Tool</a> to help you calculate how much you owe or are entitled to. Remember that
        UBI does not get income taxed. Payroll as well as UBI is going out today.
    </p>

    <p>
        Formally, the term will be dismissed on Wednesday, April 9th, 2025. The new term will begin on Thursday, April 10th, 2025. The new president and 
        the new Committee will be sworn in on the same day as the election once the polls close.
    </p>
