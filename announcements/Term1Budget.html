    <div class = "announcement-date">
        <div>March 24th, 2025</div>
        <div>President Christopher Higgins</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Two days ago, I signed Executive Order 9-12E, which is the budget for the first Presidential term. With a national reserve now established,
        I feel I can confidently dicuss the budget.
    </p>

    <p>
        5% of this budget will be going toward the salary of the President at the end of the term.
    </p>

    <p>
        10% of the budget is to be split across the comittee members' salaries to be paid at the end of the term. If there are no comittee members,
        then the Iron will be returned to the national reserve.
    </p>

    <p>
        5% will be paid out to IT for the website and other out of game services.
    </p>

    <p>
        30% will be towards the military and protecting the new found sovereignty of the Union.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest will be saved in the event it is needed or a program is created. The national reserve currently stands at roughly 300 Iron. The budget
        will scale with the reserve as it increases.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Nuggetarian Union is new and only just formed, which is why my budget seems basic. However, in doing this, we can confidently assume strong
        progress for the next term, which can focus on more Iron with a stronger economy and foundation.
    </p>
