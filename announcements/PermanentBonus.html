        <div>President Christopher Higgins</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Today, I drafted and will soon sign 7-29, The New Citizen Act. This act provides permanent bonuses to those who join the empire.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is worth mentioning that this act now prohibits all citizens from declaring themselves non-residents through invoking acts without approval
        from a presidential representative, be that the committee, president, or some other party.
    </p>

    <p>
        Citizens who join after the act is signed will get up to 512 Iron, with 64 iron being taken out every 500 meters to avoid higher taxes in the future,
        or charges for the national mailing service, unless they are a part of or will be a part of the Nuggetarian Union Nether Tunnel Service.
    </p>

    <p>
        Newcomers will not be entitled to 32 Diamonds no matter what. As well, for the first and only tax collection period of Term 2, newcomers will 
        be subject to half tax rates. They will also get full citizen rights, basic tools, and free bread.
    </p>

    <p>
        All citizens will also be entitled to a home in Nuggetaria if they want one, no matter when they joined, so long as they don't have one already.
        These will be given out at random.
    </p>
