    <p>
        Yesterday, the president drafted 9-22, an act to provide services to people not part of the Nuggetarian Union. The act is expected to be 
        signed later today.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nonresidents may not be entitled to 25% of the Universal Basic Income amount given to citizens, which is usually 192 Iron for citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nonresidents can now opt to file an optional tax return with Union collections. They can do this once per term, and then must do so the next 
        term. The Nuggetarian Union has some of the most generous tax rates from any empire, so this is a great opportunity to grow a global economy, 
        as most returns result in a refund. Nonresidents will be subject to a different tax rate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nonresidents may now vote in Union elections. They cannot run for the office themselves, but they can have say in who is in the office, as it 
        now affects them. They also cannot vote to strike down any laws or pass amendments.
    </p>

    <p>
        A budget for this act must be continuously established. The President will be setting it to 300 Iron this term. This is the mandatory minimum 
        for the budget. If this is depleted before the end of the term, then this act will be suspended until a new budget is passed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nonresidents will also be able to get a mailbox, however this cost will be taken out of any amount they recieve from The Union, as they are not 
        entitled to a waived fee as citizens are.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a nonresident belongs to an enemy state, they will not recieve any benefits, and will not be entitled to invoke this act.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            As stated, the president is expected to be signing this act later today. Changes cannot be made to this act without amendment vote.
        </b>
