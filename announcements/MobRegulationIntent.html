    <p>
        Today, I am now open to suggest on mob encampments and farms.
    </p>

    <p>
        A problem in the last empire was the government's Platform farm. While providing a sustainable way for food and resources, the area was often
        slow to go through, which wouldn't have been as much of a problem if it wasn't in the largest settled area of the empire. This time around, I
        have a few different ideas to combat this, and I am open to even further suggestions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two guaranteed pieces that will be in the drafted bill is a tax and mandatory distance. If there is a large corporate farm in a largely settled 
        area, then the farm will be taxed an extra 5% when it's time for collections. This will increase by 3% for every collection it doesn't comply with 
        regulations. The mandatory distance will be roughly 1,000 meters away from any large cities or settlements. If they are fewer than this radius, then
        they will be subject to the first item's tax.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soon, I will be signing on a comittee, and any suggestions can be brought up to them, which can then be passed on to me.
    </p>
