    <p>
        The president will be signing an amendment today to change how Committee members vote to strike down laws and impeach the President. This is
        being changed via two amendments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every election cycle, if the amendment passes, then the committee will have 100 total votes distributed amongst the members depending on the 
        percentage of the popular vote they got to be the Vice President/leader of the committee, an office that would be added with these changes 
        next term. For example, if a committee member recieved 17.3% of the votes, then they would get 17 votes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only citizens of the Nuggetarian Union may run to be the Committee Leader. When a president runs, they must have their committee decided before 
        the election. Committee members must still fulfill their duties regardless of their vote totals.
    </p>

    <p>
        The other amendment is for impeachment purposes. Should the first one pass, then the second one will come into effect. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to now impeach a president, a member of the committee must file a motion of impeachment. Then, the Vice President will inform the President, 
        and then the committee, and then the public. Within the next hour, the committee must then vote on impeaching the President. If it is a majority with 
        their weighted votes, then the public will have 12 hours to vote. Should that be a majority, then the president is impeached, and the sitting 
        government for that term is dismissed immediately with an election that Thursday.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only citizens may vote to pass these amendments.
