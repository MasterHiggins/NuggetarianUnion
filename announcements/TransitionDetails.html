    <p>
        With President Higgins' resignation pending on April 22nd, 2025, the details of this transition are now underway.
    </p>

    <p>
        On April 20th, 2025, the President will be designating standard duties over the basic function of government to the committee.
    </p>

    <p>
        The President will be signing the laws the committee wants passed on the 21st, with the others being held over to the 22nd.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anything the incoming president, Officer Elissa Chippett, needs adjusted, such as passcodes, will be done on the 21st, planned the day before.
    </p>

    <p>
        President Higgins will stay in the government for payroll, tax collections, maintenance, and other tasks until there is either a replacement or 
        those roles become redundant.
    </p>

    <p>
        President Higgins has said that, after his resignation, he will no longer be incharge of mining or military, and would be willing to sit on 
        future committees.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><i>Edited on April 16th, 2025 at 7:08 PM</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Incoming President Elissa Chippett has confirmed internally that she will not be reversing tax policies, and focusing on some expansion of 
        the city. Her targetted committee does currently include Officers Christopher Higgins and Mackenzie Moores, but not herself. Several other 
        names are also on the list to be on the committee, but only Christopher Higgins is eligible to be the Vice President.
