    <p>
        Today, I signed the budget for Term 3, which reflects sustainability and growth for citizens in the Nuggetarian Union.
    </p>

    <p>
        0.5% of this budget will be going toward the salary of the President at the end of the term.
    </p>

    <p>
        15% of the budget is to be split across the comittee members' salaries to be paid at the end of the term, capped to 512 Iron each.
    </p>

    <p>
        0.5% will be paid out to IT for the website and other out of game services.
    </p>

    <p>
        4% will be towards the military and protecting the new found sovereignty of the Union.
    </p>

    <p>
        10% of the budget will go towards the continued construction efforts in Nuggetaria, the heart province.
    </p>

    <p>
        1024 Iron will be kept aside for Universal Basic Income and other payments.
    </p>

    <p>
        7% of the budget will go towards aid provided within the Foreign Rights Act.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest will be saved in the event it is needed or a program is created. The national reserve currently stands at roughly 6000 Iron. The budget
        will scale with the reserve as it increases.
    </p>
