    <p>
        The Nuggetarian Union's government is offering this page as a way to easily access key information that citizens may be looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
        The current tax rate for both Sales and Income is 5%. The tax rate for Citizens is 7% and Businesses is 10%. The next tax collection
        date is the currently scheduled election date. If you joined the Nuggetarian Union before April 3rd, 2025, then you will not have any
        sales tax or income tax, and your standard citizen tax will be 2% until after April 3rd, 2025. <b>Please note that the president has
            updated this and will be making this the default for the first collection after April 3rd, and the tax rate is instead 0%.
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The next election for the Nuggetarian Union is April 3rd, 2025. You can vote online or at a booth on election day. Incumbent president
        Christopher Higgins is the only one running in the election.
    </p>

    <p>
        The presidential comittee consists of President Christopher Higgins (Finance) and Officer Michael Hussey-Fisher (Farming Planner).
    </p>

    <p>
        There are no current threats for sovereignty or risks to individuals that the government must make citizens notified of. This page, as well
        as a notification of some sort, will go out should this change.
