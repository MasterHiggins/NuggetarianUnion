    <p>
        The Nuggetarian Union has four standard tax methods used for collections, established under the first President Christopher Higgins. These 
        taxes are Individual, Business, Sales, and Income Tax. Their rates can be found <a href = "CommonInformation.html" target = "_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Taxes are collected each election day, but calculated the day before. This is to ensure the next president can both appoint a comittee and 
        create their budget as quickly as possible with as many funds as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        A president can decide the tax rates as soon as they assume office, however they may choose not to change the rates. If they do change rates,
        the government may have to deal with taxes until the day after election day.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Individual and Business taxes are very similar, but have different rates. This is because businesses will typically have more assets than
        individuals. This tax is calculated based on Iron assets you currently have untaxed. When taxes are calculated on Thursday, the Nuggetarian Union
        collectors check their records to see how much hasn't been taxed already, and then taxes that amount. If you or your business has less than the
        last recorded amount, <b>you do not owe that tax</b>, and the government will input it as 0.
    </p>

    <p>
        The income tax is an inidivudal tax, not for businesses. This tax is calculated based on what you were paid from a contract or working period.
        Your source of this income may either pay this tax from your pay on your behalf, or they will give you the full amount. Be sure to confirm
        this before tax calculation. When using our <a href = "TaxTool.html" target = "_blank">Tax Tool</a>, enter the amount you earned regardless of whether taxes were
        taken or not. If they were taken, then collections will enter this as 0. If it wasn't taken, then <b>you may owe the income tax</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sales tax is a business tax, however they may pass this cost to consumers, which is why it is typically low. A business is liable to pay this 
        tax <b>every election day no matter what</b>. It is on the business to calculate this tax before the checkout process. Businesses must keep their
        total sales and total assets subject to the <u>Business Tax</u> for this purpose. After election day, they are then allowed to merge these funds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our collection agents reserve the right to write off taxes for any logical reason. If an entity is sruggling, then they may write off the amount 
        to balance out to a zero. However, if an entity is not paying enough in taxes despite the rates, then collections may write in a negative amount,
        meaning that entity may owe extra. For individuals, this cannot happen unless you're reporting more than 3,000 iron in any field, and for 
        businesses, it is 4,500 Iron.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you disagree with how much you owe, you can always contact the former/acting Presidential comittee for a potential reduction or exemption before
        the next election day. If you do not contact them by that Friday, you must <b>pay what you owe</b> and try to dispute next collection day.
    </p>
