            Voting Process
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        All people who want to run in a Presidential Election must have that decided by the Wednesday before an election. Although, it is recommended 
        that candidates make themselves known before that date. They will also have their committee decided beforehand.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you vote for the President, if there are only two options, choose who you want to see become the next president. Otherwise, the process 
        becomes much different.

            Voting for the President
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        When three or more candidates are running, it might be hard for a majority of people to agree on the same person. Because of this, the Nuggetarian 
        Union uses a system of voting that's called Ranked Choice. You will select who you most want to vote for, then your second favourite option, etc.
        If your favourite option finished last place, then your second choice will be counted instead. this process repeats until there is a clear 
        majority.
    </p>

            Voting for the Committee
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        A presidential candidate runs with their committee. The members of the committee are selected by the president, but the leader/vice president 
        of the committee is voted for. There are 100 Committee votes, and the member with the most of those votes become the committee leader/Vice President.
        When you vote, no matter how many candidates are there, you still vote for just one person. Then, the total percentage of the votes they recieved 
        are the amount of votes they get on the Committee. For example, if your choice had 42% of the votes, they get 42 Committee Votes.

            What the President Does
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The president is given the power to sign any law they wish. They must then enforce that law based on interpretation, as well as any prior laws 
        from previous governments. They can strike down any law as well. they are in charge of the military and budget by default, but can carry out or 
        delegate any tasks they want to Committee Members/Officers.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What the Committee Does
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The committee is in charge of keeping the President in check. If a president passes a law or order they don't like, then they can vote it down within 
        an hour of signing. If they don't vote at all, it is law by default. They get the voting power of all their Committee Votes. As well, if the President 
        is acting out of order, then they can vote to impeach the president. In the case of impeachment, then the president is immediately removed, and the 
        Vice President assumes the role, and an election must occur by the soonest Thursday, so long as that is after 2 days from the impeachment.
